### Hi, I'm Jessica 👋🏽


I'm a Computer Scientist with MSc on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My main activities are in Language Modeling, Representation Learning, and Semantic Modeling. I'm doing a part-time PhD in Social Data Science at Oxford University.

- 💻 I’ve been working as a Machine Learning Engineer focusing on NLP. I help companies to create valuable data-driven solutions, using advanced solutions.
- 🌱 My AI passion is to discover meaningful ways to represent knowledge, taking advantage of Machine and Deep Learning algorithms and techniques.
- 🔭 You'll probably find me at intersections. I'm an interdisciplinarity advocate. I tend to see vector representations as Thought Vectors (a term popularized by Geoffrey Hinton) and I believe that in the future we will be able to model Thought Systems using NLP.
